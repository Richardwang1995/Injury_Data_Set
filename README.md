# Injury Data Analytics
Every year, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission tracks emergency rooms visits to approximately 100 hospitals. The commission uses the resulting National Electronic Injury Surveillance System data to estimate national injury statistics, but it also publishes anonymized information for each consumer product–related visit, including the associated product code (e.g., 1701: “Artificial Christmas trees”) and a short narrative (“71 YO WM FRACTURED HIP WHEN GOT DIZZY AND FELL TAKING DOWN CHRISTMAS TREE AT HOME”).


# Industry/Civic/Academic Question
1. How can we prevent the injury?
2. Can we make the product safer?
3. If we can make the product safer, should we make it cheaper or more expensive?
4. How can we attract customers to buy our new and more safer products?
