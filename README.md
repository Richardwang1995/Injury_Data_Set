# Injury_Data_Set
Every year, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission tracks emergency rooms visits to approximately 100 hospitals. The commission uses the resulting National Electronic Injury Surveillance System data to estimate national injury statistics, but it also publishes anonymized information for each consumer product–related visit, including the associated product code (e.g., 1701: “Artificial Christmas trees”) and a short narrative (“71 YO WM FRACTURED HIP WHEN GOT DIZZY AND FELL TAKING DOWN CHRISTMAS TREE AT HOME”).
